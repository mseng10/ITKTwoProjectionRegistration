Overview
--------

An `ITK <http://itk.org>`_-based implementation of intensity-based 2D/3D rigid
image registration for patient setup assessment in external beam radiotherapy.
The registration framework was designed to simultaneously register two
projection images to a 3D image volume. The projection geometry was set up to
simulate the X-ray imaging system that attached to a medical linear
accelerator for cancer treatment. The normalized correlation was used as the
similarity measure and the Powell's optimizer was used as the optimization
method. Siddon-Jacobs fast ray-tracing algorithm was implemented to compute
projection images from a 3D image volume.

A more detailed description can be found in the Insight Journal article::

Since ITK 4.10.0, this module is available in the ITK source tree as a Remote
module. To enable it, set::

  Module_TwoProjectionRegistration:BOOL=ON

in ITK's CMake build configuration.
